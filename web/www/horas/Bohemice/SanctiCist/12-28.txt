[Ant Vespera 3]
Od dvou let * a níže zabil Herodes mnoho chlapců kvůli Pánu.
Nechte maličké * ke mně přijíti, takovým lidem totiž patří království nebeské.
Vyprali své oděvy * a vybělili je v krvi Beránkově.
Tito jsou vykoupeni * jako první z lidí pro Boha a Beránka, a v jejich ústech nebyla nalezena lež.

Budou se mnou kráčet v bílém, * neboť jsou hodni, a nevymažu jejich jména z knihy života.
